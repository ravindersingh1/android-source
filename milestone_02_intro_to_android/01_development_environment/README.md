## Development Environment

Yes, we're at this again. After downloading and installing [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html), launch it. If Android Studio requires any additional downloads, say yes.

When you see the starter window asking you to either create a new project, import or open one, choose "Open project…" Navigate to the folder within this directory, `MyFirstAndroidApplication/` and press enter. This may take some time, please be patient.

Allow the on-screen tooltip to teach you more about Android Studio and its various shortcuts and abilities… That is until you get annoyed with it.

Once the project is fully-loaded, press the green triangle in the toolbar, aka run the application. Plug your device into your computer and watch the device's screen for a trust verification between your device and your computer, press accept. Highlight the device in your list of run targets and press okay.

**My First Android Application** will now launch momentarily on your device. Rejoice!
