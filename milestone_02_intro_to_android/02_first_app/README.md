## My First Android Application

Your assignment is to start a new Android application: **BlocNotes**. BlocNotes will be the Android ship which sails you across the sea of knowledge… Looking back at that sentence, I regret it but I'd feel disingenuous taking it back.

During the next few milestones, you will be learning paramount Android features and APIs as you incorporate them into BlocNotes, a simple note-storing application. By the end of it, your copy of BlocNotes will be an incredibly well-rounded Android application with features expected of a high quality product.

* **Launch Android Studio** Start Android Studio and wait for it to load. If you have a previous project open, close it. The helper window should be visible now. Select "New Project…"

* **Fill In Details** Match the details below. Place the project at the root of your android-source folder

* **Create A Launcher Icon** This is the icon of your BlocNotes application. You can match the one I have below with a color of #262626 or make whatever you like. Take your time if you're one of those creative types :)

* **Wait** This might take a little bit of time…
