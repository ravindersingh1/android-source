## Methods

Open your command prompt and `cd` into this README's directory (methods). In the src path is a file named `Methods.java`. Open it and fill in the portions of the code where the comments have indicated.

When you've completed your work, test your code by compiling it with the following command:

``` bash
$ javac -d bin/ src/com/bloc/methods/Methods.java
```

Correct any and all errors that appear. If something goes wrong during compilation, it will be a result from the new code.

After it returns successfully, `cd` into the bin directory:

``` bash
$ cd bin/
```

From within bin, run the following command:

``` bash
$ java com.bloc.methods.Methods
```

If you see a message telling you that your methods worked perfectly, you're done! Commit your changes and push them to Github.
