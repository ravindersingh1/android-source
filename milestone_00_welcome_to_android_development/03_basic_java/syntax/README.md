## Syntax Disaster

Open your command prompt and `cd` into this README's directory (syntax).

_Attempt to_ compile the Java code by running the following command:

``` bash
$ javac -d bin src/com/bloc/syntax/SyntaxDisaster.java
```

If you see errors, you've come to the right place. Edit `SyntaxDisaster.java` with your favorite text editor and fix all of the syntax errors. Test your changes by repeating the command above until it succeeds.

Finally, execute your fixed Java code by invoking the following command from within `bin/`:

``` bash
$ java com.bloc.syntax.SyntaxDisaster
```

If you see a message printed to the prompt, everything with the world is right once more. Commit your changes to Github.
